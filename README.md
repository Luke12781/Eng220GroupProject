Project Abstract: 
With the rapid development of modern infrastructure, we often fail to see the burden of environmental hazards and conditions that low-income communities and people of colour endure. Look no further than the native american tribes in New Mexico. During the 1940s and onward, uranium was mined, which affected the groundwater and air pollution, leading to significant health problems like cancer, kidney disease, and respiratory illnesses. The motive of this project is to investigate the extent to which environmental injustice affects different populations and communities. In this project, we will be observing communities that differ in income. We anticipate identifying where those low-income communities face higher environmental hardships, leading to health instability. 

For this research, we will use the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Environmental Justice Index (EJI) dataset. The dataset integrates 36 environmental health indicators across five domains with socioeconomic variables, which is great for this area of study. We assume that low-income populations will face higher EJI scores, leading to greater risk. We aim to provide data for knowledge-based learning and awareness, and urban planning to decrease environmental injustices.
